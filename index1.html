    <h2 style="color: black;">How to play?</h2>
    <h4 style="color: brown;">In the game, players complete levels by swapping colored pieces of candy on a game board
        to make a match of three or more of the same color, eliminating those candies from the board and replacing them
        with new ones, which could potentially create further matches. Matches of four or more candies create unique
        candies that act as power-ups with larger board-clearing abilities. Boards have various goals that must be
        completed within a fixed number of moves, such as collecting a specific number of a type of candy. </h4>
